I am currently a Fellow at the German Ministry of Finance (Bundesministerium der Finanzen, BMF).

In my research work, I apply econometric methods to questions at the intersections of environmental, growth, and health economics.

I did my doctoral studies at the [Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/) (submitted June 2021, defense scheduled December 2021). Before, I worked as a senior consultant for the German Development Agency, GIZ, and in the policy planning staff at the Federal Chancellery. I also did consulting work on data projects with governments, NGOs, media organizations, and the private sector. My Masters are from the London School of Economics and Sciences Po Paris. I did my undergraduate studies at Sciences Po Paris and the University of Oxford. My CV is available [here](https://smkraus.github.io/files/kraus_cv.pdf).
