I'm a PhD Candidate in economics at the [Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/) in Berlin, Germany. I apply econometric methods to questions at the intersections of environmental, development, and health economics.

Before my doctoral studies I worked as a senior consultant for the German Development Agency, GIZ, and in the policy planning staff at the Federal Chancellery. I also did consulting work on data projects with governments, NGOs, media organizations, and the private sector. My Masters are from the London School of Economics and Sciences Po Paris. I did my undergraduate studies at Sciences Po Paris and the University of Oxford.

## Data and code
I have worked extensively with geographical and survey data from Indonesia and I'm currently preparing a data repository with crosswalks for geographical and industry identifiers. Please reach out, if you need this data.
